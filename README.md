This project provides the official implementation for our ICCV2021 paper 
"[FaPN: Feature-aligned Pyramid Network for Dense Image Prediction](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2108.07058.pdf)" 
based on [Detectron2](https://github.com/facebookresearch/detectron2). 
FaPN is a simple yet effective top-down pyramidal architecture to generate multi-scale features for dense image prediction.
Comprised of a feature alignment module (FAM) and a feature selection module (FSM), FaPN addresses the issue of feature alignment
in  the original [FPN](https://arxiv.org/abs/1612.03144), leading improvements on various dense prediction tasks, such as object detection, semantic, instance, panoptic segmentation, etc. 


## Code and pre-trained models are coming soon.
