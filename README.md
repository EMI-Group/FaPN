## Overview
<img align="right" width="600" src="fpn_vs_fapn.png">

This project provides the official implementation for our ICCV2021 paper 
"[FaPN: Feature-aligned Pyramid Network for Dense Image Prediction](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2108.07058.pdf)" 
based on [Detectron2](https://github.com/facebookresearch/detectron2). 
FaPN is a conceptually simple and effective framework for desne image prediction tasks,
which solves the feature misalignement in Feature Pyramid Networks.


### Code and trained models are coming soon.
